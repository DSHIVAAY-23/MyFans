# MyFans – Decentralized Content Subscription Platform

**MyFans** is a decentralized platform built on **Starknet** that enables content creators to monetize their work directly and transparently. By leveraging blockchain technology, MyFans removes intermediaries, allowing fans to support creators through on-chain subscriptions and direct payments.

---

## 🎯 Problem MyFans Solves

### Centralized Platforms
- **Creators lose a significant portion** of their earnings to platform fees.
- **Payments are delayed** or controlled by intermediaries, which can cause frustrations for creators and fans.
- There is a **lack of transparency** in how funds are handled.
- Content access and ownership are **controlled by the platform** rather than the creator.

---

## 🛠️ Solution

**MyFans** provides a **Web3-native platform** with the following key features:
- **Direct Subscription Payments**: Fans pay creators directly via smart contracts, removing intermediaries.
- **Transparent Revenue**: Payments are automatically split and sent to the creator with a minimal service fee retained by the platform.
- **On-Chain Content Access Control**: Subscription status and content access are tracked and verified on-chain.
- **Off-Chain Content Storage**: Content metadata (e.g., links or access keys) is securely stored on IPFS to ensure scalability and privacy.

---

## 🧱 Architecture

### 1. **Smart Contracts (Cairo + Starknet)**
- **Subscription Contract**: Manages fan subscriptions, durations, and auto-renewals.
- **Payment Logic**: Directs payments to creators and retains a small service fee.
- **Access Control**: Ensures only active subscribers can access premium content.

### 2. **Frontend (React.js + Starknet.js)**
- A user-friendly interface for both creators and fans.
- Integrated with **Argent X** and **Braavos** wallets for seamless blockchain interaction.
- Displays user subscription status, content previews, and interaction history.

### 3. **Off-Chain Storage (IPFS)**
- Content is stored off-chain on IPFS to reduce costs and increase privacy.
- The contract stores only metadata (e.g., links, content hashes) on-chain, referencing the content on IPFS.

### 4. **Indexing (Apibara/Starknet Indexer)**
- Real-time data tracking for subscription statuses, content interactions, and more.
- Useful for analytics, dashboards, and personalized notifications.
